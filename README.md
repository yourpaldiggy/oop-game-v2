This is my take on the Object Oriented Programmed Guessing Game for Team Treehouse.

I've gone for Exceeds Expectations.

Personal CSS edits: 
Changed the win screen color from #78CF82 to #014409 for a darker green winning screen.
Changed the lose screen color from #D94545 to #ff0000 for a brighter red losing screen.
